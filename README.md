# To Run:  

## You need both NodeJS and Python installed to run this program  

open a terminal in the directory  
run `./build.bat`  
run `./run.bat`  

When closing the program, ensure that you terminate both the frontend and backend via `Ctrl-C` rather than just closing the window.  

If you want to get rid of the python libraries that were installed, run these commands:  
pip uninstall flask  
pip uninstall flask-cors  
pip uninstall pymongo
